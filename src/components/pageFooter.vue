        <h4>FAQs</h4>
        <h3>What is TypeScholar?</h3>
        <p>It's an app that queries Wikipedia's API for your search term and then you speed-type the result.</p>
        <h3>Why though?</h3>
        <p>I just wanted to code something...</p>
        <h3>Who are you?</h3>
        <p>I'm Peter, a developer from London, UK, and I have a <a href="#">blog that I neglect</a></p>
        <h3>Can I help you somehow?</h3>
        <p>Ehhh. Probably not, but the hosting does cost a few quid so I'll shill a little...<br> If this website made you realise (with quite a scare) that you actually don't own a keyboard,<br>
        you could use <a href="https://amzn.to/2uSBRSv">this Amazon affiliate link</a> to rectify that...<br> <a href="https://amzn.to/2LLYj6b">Or these wireless headphones which I actually own.</a></p>
        <h3>Anything else?</h3>
